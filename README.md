This repository contains 3 Python projects I created and one I only edited
- a Finance calculator using if, elif statements to calculate interest and bond repayments
- my version of PyGame, with a player object, 3 enemy objects, a prize object, collision detection etc.
- taskmanager.py, a simple CRUD application using text files, this program manages tasks given to employees
- PoisedPM.java, the same CRUD application but in Java.
